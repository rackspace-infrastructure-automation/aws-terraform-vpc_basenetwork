# aws-terraform-vpc\_basenetwork

This module sets up basic network components for an account in a specific region. Optionally it will setup a basic VPN gateway and VPC flow logs.

## Basic Usage

```HCL
module "vpc" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-vpc_basenetwork//?ref=v0.12.2"

  vpc_name = "MyVPC"
}
```

 Full working references are available at [examples](examples)
## Default Resources

By default only `vpc_name` is required to be set. Unless changed `aws_region` defaults to `us-west-2` and will need to be updated for other regions. `source` will also need to be declared depending on where the module lives. Given default settings the following resources are created:

 - VPC Flow Logs
 - 2 AZs with public/private subnets from the list of 3 static CIDRs ranges available for each as defaults
 - Public/private subnets with the count related to custom\_azs if defined or region AZs automatically calculated by Terraform otherwise
 - NAT Gateways will be created in each AZ's first public subnet
 - EIPs will be created in all public subnets for NAT gateways to use
 - Route Tables, including routes to NAT gateways if applicable

## Terraform 0.12 upgrade

Several changes were required while adding terraform 0.12 compatibility.  The following changes should be  
made when upgrading from a previous release to version 0.12.0 or higher.

### Module variables

The following module variables were updated to better meet current Rackspace style guides:

- `custom_tags` -> `tags`
- `vpc_name` -> `name`
