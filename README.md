# aws-terraform-vpc_basenetwork

This module sets up basic network components for an account in a specific region. Optionally it will setup a basic VPN gateway and VPC flow logs.

## Basic Usage

```
module "vpc" {
 source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-vpc_basenetwork//?ref=v0.0.5"

 vpc_name = "MyVPC"
}
```

## Default Resources

By default only `vpc_name` is required to be set. Unless changed `aws_region` defaults to `us-west-2` and will need to be updated for other regions. `source` will also need to be declared depending on where the module lives. Given default settings the following resources are created:

- VPC Flow Logs
- 2 AZs with public/private subnets from the list of 3 static CIDRs ranges available for each as defaults
- Public/private subnets with the count related to custom_azs if defined or region AZs automatically calculated by Terraform otherwise
- NAT Gateways will be created in each AZ's first public subnet
- EIPs will be created in all public subnets for NAT gateways to use
- Route Tables, including routes to NAT gateways if applicable


## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| vpc\_name | Name for the VPC | string | - | yes |
| az\_count | Number of AZs to utilize for the subnets | string | `2` | no |
| build\_flow\_logs | Whether or not to build flow log components | string | `false` | no |
| build\_nat\_gateways | Whether or not to build a NAT gateway per AZ | string | `true` | no |
| build\_vpn | Whether or not to build a VPN gateway | string | `false` | no |
| cidr\_range | CIDR range for the VPC | string | `172.18.0.0/16` | no |
| custom\_azs | A list of AZs that VPC resources will reside in | list | `<list>` | no |
| custom\_tags | Optional tags to be applied on top of the base tags on all resources | map | `<map>` | no |
| default\_tenancy | Default tenancy for instances. Either multi-tenant (default) or single-tenant (dedicated) | string | `default` | no |
| domain\_name | Custom domain name for the VPC | string | `` | no |
| domain\_name\_servers | Array of custom domain name servers | list | `<list>` | no |
| enable\_dns\_hostnames | Whether or not to enable DNS hostnames for the VPC | string | `true` | no |
| enable\_dns\_support | Whether or not to enable DNS support for the VPC | string | `true` | no |
| enable\_ipv6 | Whether or not to enable IPv6 support for the VPC | string | `false` | no |
| environment | Application environment for which this network is being created. e.g. Development/Production | string | `Development` | no |
| private\_cidr\_ranges | An array of CIDR ranges to use for private subnets | list | `<list>` | no |
| private\_subnet\_names | Text that will be included in generated name for private subnets. Given the default value of `["Private"]`, subnet names in the form \"<vpc_name>-Private<count+1>\", e.g. \"MyVpc-Public2\" will be produced. Otherwise, given a list of names with length the same as the value of `az_count`, the first `az_count` subnets will be named using the first string in the list, the second `az_count` subnets will be named using the second string, and so on. | list | `<list>` | no |
| private\_subnets\_per\_az | Number of private subnets to create in each AZ. NOTE: This value, when multiplied by the value of `az_count`, should not exceed the length of the `private_cidr_ranges` list! | string | `1` | no |
| public\_cidr\_ranges | An array of CIDR ranges to use for public subnets | list | `<list>` | no |
| public\_subnet\_names | Text that will be included in generated name for public subnets. Given the default value of `["Public"]`, subnet names in the form \"<vpc_name>-Public<count+1>\", e.g. \"MyVpc-Public1\" will be produced. Otherwise, given a list of names with length the same as the value of `az_count`, the first `az_count` subnets will be named using the first string in the list, the second `az_count` subnets will be named using the second string, and so on. | list | `<list>` | no |
| public\_subnets\_per\_az | Number of public subnets to create in each AZ. NOTE: This value, when multiplied by the value of `az_count`, should not exceed the length of the `public_cidr_ranges` list! | string | `1` | no |
| spoke\_vpc | Whether or not the VPN gateway is a spoke of a Transit VPC | string | `false` | no |
