# aws-terraform-vpc_basenetwork

This module sets up basic network components for an account in a specific region. Optionally it will setup a basic VPN gateway and VPC flow logs.

## Basic Usage

```
module "vpc" {
 source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-vpc_basenetwork//?ref=v0.0.5"

 vpc_name = "MyVPC"
}
```

Full working references are available at [examples](examples)
## Default Resources

By default only `vpc_name` is required to be set. Unless changed `aws_region` defaults to `us-west-2` and will need to be updated for other regions. `source` will also need to be declared depending on where the module lives. Given default settings the following resources are created:

- VPC Flow Logs
- 2 AZs with public/private subnets from the list of 3 static CIDRs ranges available for each as defaults
- Public/private subnets with the count related to custom_azs if defined or region AZs automatically calculated by Terraform otherwise
- NAT Gateways will be created in each AZ's first public subnet
- EIPs will be created in all public subnets for NAT gateways to use
- Route Tables, including routes to NAT gateways if applicable

| logging\_bucket\_access\_control | Define ACL for Bucket from one of the [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl): private, public-read, public-read-write, aws-exec-read, authenticated-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control, log-delivery-write | string | `"bucket-owner-full-control"` | no |
| logging\_bucket\_encryption | Enable default bucket encryption. i.e. AES256 | aws:kms | string | `"AES256"` | no |

| logging\_bucket\_force\_destroy | Whether all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable. ie. true | string | `"false"` | no |

| private\_subnet\_names | Text that will be included in generated name for private subnets. Given the default value of `["Private"]`, subnet names in the form \"<vpc_name>-Private<count+1>\", e.g. \"MyVpc-Public2\" will be produced. Otherwise, given a list of names with length the same as the value of `az_count`, the first `az_count` subnets will be named using the first string in the list, the second `az_count` subnets will be named using the second string, and so on. | list | `<list>` | no |
| private\_subnet\_tags | A list of maps containing tags to be applied to private subnets. List should either be the same length as the number of AZs to apply different tags per set of subnets, or a length of 1 to apply the same tags across all private subnets. | list | `<list>` | no |
| private\_subnets\_per\_az | Number of private subnets to create in each AZ. NOTE: This value, when multiplied by the value of `az_count`, should not exceed the length of the `private_cidr_ranges` list! | string | `"1"` | no |
| public\_cidr\_ranges | An array of CIDR ranges to use for public subnets | list | `<list>` | no |
| public\_subnet\_names | Text that will be included in generated name for public subnets. Given the default value of `["Public"]`, subnet names in the form \"<vpc_name>-Public<count+1>\", e.g. \"MyVpc-Public1\" will be produced. Otherwise, given a list of names with length the same as the value of `az_count`, the first `az_count` subnets will be named using the first string in the list, the second `az_count` subnets will be named using the second string, and so on. | list | `<list>` | no |
| public\_subnet\_tags | A list of maps containing tags to be applied to public subnets. List should either be the same length as the number of AZs to apply different tags per set of subnets, or a length of 1 to apply the same tags across all public subnets. | list | `<list>` | no |
| public\_subnets\_per\_az | Number of public subnets to create in each AZ. NOTE: This value, when multiplied by the value of `az_count`, should not exceed the length of the `public_cidr_ranges` list! | string | `"1"` | no |
| spoke\_vpc | Whether or not the VPN gateway is a spoke of a Transit VPC | string | `"false"` | no |
